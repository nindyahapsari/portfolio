# Personal Project Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project repository! This repository serves as a collection of projects that I have worked on, 
showcasing my skills and capabilities as a developer. 
It includes a todo list application and a collection of GitHub repositories.
Since I put everything into one project, I did not distinguish my file per folder.

## Projects

### 1. Todo List App

The **Todo List App** is a simple yet functional application built using React.js, Vite It allows users to manage their tasks by providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app utilizes local storage to persist the data on the user's device, ensuring that the tasks are available even after refreshing the page.

The main features of the Todo List App include:

- Add new tasks with a title and optional description.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Remove tasks from the list.

To run the App locally, since I use Vite, perhaps it will be good to install the dependencies  with Vite.

### 2. GitHub Repo Collection

The **GitHub Repo Collection** is an application that I created using GitHub API, GraphQL Apollo, and basic CRUD handling. It focuses on showcasing the LunarVim repository and provides dynamic functionality for fetching repository data and adjusting the number of repositories displayed.

Key features of the GitHub Repo Collection app include:

- **Display LunarVim Repository**: The app specifically highlights the LunarVim repository, showcasing its name, description, and owner details.

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: The app allows users to adjust the number of repositories displayed using three buttons at the top. By clicking on a number (e.g., 5, 10, or 30), the app refetches the repository data and presents the corresponding number of repository cards.

- **GraphQL Apollo Integration**: GraphQL Apollo is integrated into the app to efficiently query and manage data from the GitHub API. It enhances the performance and flexibility of the app's data fetching capabilities.

- **React Router Integration**: React Router is integrated into the app, enabling smooth navigation between different sections and enhancing the overall user experience.



## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository are primarily built using the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and opinionated web development build tool that serves as an alternative to Create React App.
- **Apollo GraphQL**: A comprehensive GraphQL client that integrates well with React.js and other frameworks.
- **Formik**: A library for handling forms in React.js, providing an intuitive and efficient way to manage form state and validation.
- **React Router**: A routing library for React applications, facilitating navigation between different sections of the app.
